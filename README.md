Brumal â€” A First-Person Spelunking Horror Game

Our game is about two friends who go into a cave where they encounter a terrifying cadre of zealots, beasts, and demonic forces; they are separated, one of them is abducted. The other is now forced to traverse deeper into the mine to rescue his friend, sneaking and breaking his way deeper into the ravenous pit that swallowed his friend.
